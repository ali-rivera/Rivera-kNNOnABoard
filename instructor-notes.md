# Instructor Notes

## Materials 
This activity is "unplugged" and therefore requires some materials. The kNN board below can be printed in many different formats, but for sustainability of resources it is recommended that the image be printed as large as 24" x 36" and laminated. We find using dry erase markers on the laminated surface successful for student engagement and longevity of materials.

## True Values
We recommend witholding the true values below until students have made a classification for each of their k values. Often this results in a teachable moment where they do not have the true values, and will struggle to determine which k is best with missing information. This productive struggle raises questions and creates a memorable connection to the process for students.

<br /> **Point B:** Not Purchased (Orange)
<br /> **Point C:** Not Purchased (Orange)
<br /> **Point D:** Purchased (Blue)
<br /> **Point E:** Purchased (Blue)

## Follow Up Questions
We have included warm-up questions for instructors to use in the instructional period following this activity to guide recall and extend the concepts explored in the lab. 

1. What are the steps involved in kNN?

2. As k increases, does the model overfit or underfit? Why?

3. Give an example of another situation where kNN could be used.

4. Why is kNN considered a "lazy" algorithm?
